# JavaScript-SnakeGame

I have recently got back into writing programs in JavaScript using IntelliJ IDEA. I wanted to use my abilities to create game a copy of the retro game Snake. I didn't have prior knowledge of how to do this in JS and it took a good chunk of time researching the ways in which to code this game but I got there eventually and produced a simple yet addictive HTML/JS version of the famous retro video game.

Files include;

snake.html
snake.css
snake.js

snake.html
- used to represent the game in w web format for browsers

snake.css
- used to do styling of classes and elements within the game such as the background, colour of snake, colour of fruit, etc

snake.js
- used as the brains of the game, where the whole program is run, all the game variables, controls, actions are written in this file.
